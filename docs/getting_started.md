## Getting started

First, you need to install the library:

```bash
pip install PyCharacterAI
```

\
Import the `Client` class from the library and create a new instance of it:

```Python
from PyCharacterAI import Client
```

```Python
client = Client()
```

Then you need to authenticate `client` using `token`:

```Python
await client.authenticate("TOKEN")
```

> if you want to be able to upload your avatar you also need to specify `web_next_auth` token as an additional argument (only this way for now, this may change in the future):
>
> ```Python
> await client.authenticate("TOKEN", web_next_auth="WEB_NEXT_AUTH")
> ```

\
Or you can just call `get_client()` method:

```Python
from PyCharacterAI import get_client

client = await get_client(token="TOKEN", web_next_auth="WEB_NEXT_AUTH")
```

After authentication, we can use all available library methods.

## About tokens and how to get them
>
> ⚠️ WARNING, DO NOT SHARE THESE TOKENS WITH ANYONE! Anyone with your tokens has full access to your account!

This library uses two types of tokens: a common `token` and `web_next_auth`. The first one is required for almost all methods here and the second one only and only for `upload_avatar()` method (may change in the future).

### Instructions for getting a `token`

1. Open the Character.AI website in your browser
2. Open the `developer tools` (`F12`, `Ctrl+Shift+I`, or `Cmd+J`)
3. Go to the `Nerwork` tab
4. Interact with website in some way, for example, go to your profile and look for `Authorization` in the request header
5. Copy the value after `Token`

> For example, token in `https://plus.character.ai/chat/user/public/following/` request headers:

### Instructions for getting a `web_next_auth` token

1. Open the Character.AI website in your browser
2. Open the `developer tools` (`F12`, `Ctrl+Shift+I`, or `Cmd+J`)
3. Go to the `Storage` section and click on `Cookies`
4. Look for the `web-next-auth` key
5. Copy its value

## Some important concepts

> Further, in the documentation you can find  certain concepts, some of them I want to explain below. Some concepts related to character creation and user personas can be found in the official [character book](https://book.character.ai/character-book/).

### turn and candidate

**Turn** *is a message in chat. It contains one or more `candidates` that represent the content of this message. Just keep in mind that `turn` == `message`.*

**Candidate** (or **TurnCandidate**) *is the "content" of the message (`turn`). A message can have several `candidates` (for example, when you swipe the character's answer on the c.ai website, you create new `candidate` for the character's message).*

**Primary candidate** - *currently selected `candidate`. When you send a new message to the chat, you reply to this (primary) `message candidate`. When a new alternative response is generated, `primary candidate` automatically updates to the newly generated `candidate`. You can also manually set a specific `turn candidate` as a primary if you want to reply to a particular `message candidate`. (Refer to the documentation for more details.)*

## Examples

> Here are just some examples of the library's features. If you want to know about all `methods` and `types` with explanations, go to [methods](https://github.com/Xtr4F/PyCharacterAI/blob/main/docs/api_reference/methods.md) and [types](https://github.com/Xtr4F/PyCharacterAI/blob/main/docs/api_reference/types.md) documentation sections.

### Simple chatting example

```Python
import asyncio

from PyCharacterAI import get_client
from PyCharacterAI.exceptions import SessionClosedError

token = "TOKEN"
character_id = "ID"


async def main():
    client = await get_client(token=token)

    me = await client.account.fetch_me()
    print(f"Authenticated as @{me.username}")

    chat, greeting_message = await client.chat.create_chat(character_id)

    print(f"{greeting_message.author_name}: {greeting_message.get_primary_candidate().text}")

    try:
        while True:
            # NOTE: input() is blocking function!
            message = input(f"[{me.name}]: ")

            answer = await client.chat.send_message(character_id, chat.chat_id, message)
            print(f"[{answer.author_name}]: {answer.get_primary_candidate().text}")

    except SessionClosedError:
        print("session closed. Bye!")

    finally:
        # Don't forget to explicitly close the session
        await client.close_session()

asyncio.run(main())
```

---

A more advanced example. You can use so-called streaming to receive a message in parts, as is done on a website, instead of waiting for it to be completely generated:

```Python
import asyncio

from PyCharacterAI import get_client
from PyCharacterAI.exceptions import SessionClosedError

token = "TOKEN"
character_id = "ID"


async def main():
    client = await get_client(token=token)

    me = await client.account.fetch_me()
    print(f'Authenticated as @{me.username}')

    chat, greeting_message = await client.chat.create_chat(character_id)

    print(f"[{greeting_message.author_name}]: {greeting_message.get_primary_candidate().text}")

    try:
        while True:
            # NOTE: input() is blocking function!
            message = input(f"[{me.name}]: ")

            answer = await client.chat.send_message(character_id, chat.chat_id, message, streaming=True)

            printed_length = 0
            async for message in answer:
                if printed_length == 0:
                    print(f"[{message.author_name}]: ", end="")

                text = message.get_primary_candidate().text
                print(text[printed_length:], end="")

                printed_length = len(text)
            print("\n")

    except SessionClosedError:
        print("session closed. Bye!")

    finally:
        # Don't forget to explicitly close the session
        await client.close_session()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Working with images

```Python
# We can generate images by a prompt
# (It will return list of urls)
images = await client.utils.generate_image("prompt")
```

```Python
# We can upload an image to use it as an 
# avatar for character/persona/profile

# NOTE: This method requires the specified web_next_auth token
avatar_file = "path to file or url"
avatar = await client.utils.upload_avatar(avatar_file)
```

---

### Working with voices

```Python
# We can search for voices
voices = await client.utils.search_voices("name")
```

```Python
# We can upload the audio as a voice
voice_file = "path to file or url"
voice = await client.utils.upload_voice(voice_file, "voice name")
```

```Python
# We can set and unset a voice for character  
await client.account.set_voice("character_id", "voice_id")
await client.account.unset_voice("character_id")
```

```Python
# And we can use voice to generate speech from the character's messages
speech = await client.utils.generate_speech("chat_id", "turn_id", "candidate_id", "voice_id")

# It will return bytes, so we can use it for example like this:
filepath = "voice.mp3"

with open(filepath, 'wb') as f:
  f.write(speech)
```

```Python
# or we can get just the url.
speech_url = await client.utils.generate_speech("chat_id", "turn_id", "candidate_id", 
                                            "voice_id", return_url=True)

```
